Debt-Based Scoring

This module computes miner weights based on debt ledger information.
The algorithm pays miners based on their previous payout period's performance (PnL scaled by penalties),
proportionally distributing emissions to cover remaining debt by end of the current week.

Key Concepts:
- Activation began 2025-11-01, and was originally on a monthly basis
- Payout periods are now weekly, starting and ending at midnight on Sunday, 00:00:00 UTC
- "Needed payout" = Cumulative earnings from activation through end of previous pay period (PnL in USD * penalties)
- "Actual payout" = Cumulative emissions paid from activation through current time (emissions in USD)
- "Remaining payout" = needed_payout_usd - actual_payout_usd (in USD)
- "Projected emissions" = Estimated total ALPHA available, converted to USD for comparison
- Weights = Proportional to remaining_payout_usd, with warning if insufficient emissions
- Cumulative tracking allows negative PnL to carry forward and offset future gains

Algorithm Flow:
- Calculate needed_payout_usd from activation through end of previous pay period (only MAINCOMP/PROBATION checkpoints)
- Calculate actual_payout_usd from activation through current time (only MAINCOMP/PROBATION checkpoints)
- Calculate remaining_payout_usd for each miner (in USD)
- Query real-time TAO emission rate from subtensor
- Convert to ALPHA, then convert ALPHA to USD using current conversion rates
- Project total USD value available over current pay period
- Set weights proportional to remaining_payout_usd
- Warn if sum(remaining_payouts_usd) > projected_usd_emissions
- Enforce minimum weights based on challenge period status:
    - CHALLENGE/PLAGIARISM: 1x dust
    - PROBATION: 2x dust
    - MAINCOMP: 3x dust
    - UNKNOWN: 0x dust (no weight)
- Normalize weights with burn address logic:
    - If sum < 1.0: assign (1.0 - sum) to burn address (uid 229 mainnet / uid 5 testnet)
    - If sum >= 1.0: normalize to 1.0, burn address gets 0

Important Notes:
- Debt-based scoring activated December 2025 (on a monthly basis, paid for November 2025)
- Before December 2025, miners only received minimum dust weights
- Excess weight (when sum < 1.0) goes to burn address (uid 229 mainnet, uid 220 testnet)
- Checkpoints are 12-hour intervals (2 per day)
- Uses real-time subtensor queries for emission rate estimation

        Compute miner weights based on debt ledger information with real-time emission projections.

        The algorithm works as follows:
        - For each miner, calculate their "needed payout" from activation through end of previous pay period (cumulative)
        - Calculate "actual payout" from activation through current time (cumulative)
        - Calculate "remaining payout" to be distributed (allows negative PnL to carry forward)
        - Query real-time TAO emission rate from metagraph
        - Convert to ALPHA using reserve data from shared metagraph (TAO/ALPHA ratio)
        - Project total ALPHA available from now until day 25
        - Set weights proportional to remaining_payout
        - Warn if sum(remaining_payouts) > projected_emissions
        - Enforce minimum weights with static dust (performance-scaled by 30-day PnL within buckets)
        - Normalize weights with burn address logic (sum < 1.0 → burn gets excess)
