# Vanta API and Websocket Data

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive API server and client for the [Vanta Network - Bittensor subnet 8](https://github.com/taoshidev/vanta-network/blob/main/docs/validator.md). It features both REST and WebSocket endpoints that enable real-time access to trading data, positions, statistics, and other critical information.

The REST API server is designed for validators to efficiently provide Vanta data to consumers, with support for different data freshness tiers, real-time updates, and secure authentication.

The Websocket server allows for real-time streaming of trading data, enabling clients to receive updates as they happen.

The Websocket client is built to interact with the Websocket server, allowing for real-time data streaming and processing. 

## Features

- **Dual API Support**:
  - REST API for standard HTTP requests
  - WebSocket API for real-time data streaming
- **Secure Authentication**:
  - Dynamic API key management with automatic refresh
  - Token-based authentication for all endpoints
- **Data Tiering**:
  - Support for different data freshness tiers (0%, 30%, 50%, 100%)
  - Customizable pricing models for data access
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - GZIP compression for large payloads
  - Batch message processing for WebSocket communications
  - Efficient sequence tracking for message reliability
- **Fault Tolerance**:
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Process isolation for stability

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **API Manager**: Coordinates the REST and WebSocket services, handles process management, and maintains shared state.
2. **REST Server**: Provides HTTP endpoints for querying historical data and statistics.
3. **WebSocket Server**: Enables real-time data streaming with sequence tracking.

## Configuration

### API Keys Management

API keys are stored in a JSON file with the following format:

```json
    {
      "user_id": {
        "key": "the_api_key_string",
        "tier": <0,30,50,100>
      },
      ...
    }

    Where tier values represent access levels:
    - 0: Basic access (24-hour lagged data, no real-time access)
    - 30: Standard access (30% real-time data)
    - 50: Enhanced access (50% real-time data)
    - 100: Premium access (100% data freshness + WebSocket support)
```

By default, the system looks for this file at the relative path `vanta_api/api_keys.json`. The API keys are automatically refreshed from disk, allowing you to add or remove keys without restarting the server.


The [Request Network](https://request.taoshi.io/) is a Taoshi product which serves subnet data while handling security, rate limiting, data customization, and provides a polished customer-facing and validator setup UI. Running this repo's APIManager is a prerequisite to serving data on the Request Network

For end users who want to access Vanta data, you will need a Request Network API key. If you have any issues or questions, please reach out to the Taoshi team on Discord.

### Command Line Options

```
standalone usage: python api_manager.py [-h] [--serve] [--api-host API_HOST] [--api-rest-port API_REST_PORT]
                     [--api-ws-port API_WS_PORT] [--netuid NETUID] ...

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                       Show this help message and exit
  --serve                          Start the API server for REST and WebSocket endpoints
  --api-host API_HOST              Host address for the API server (default: 127.0.0.1)
  --api-rest-port API_REST_PORT    Port for the REST API server (default: 48888)
  --api-ws-port API_WS_PORT        Port for the WebSocket server (default: 8765)
  
 Provide the same args when running as a part of your SN8 validator.
```

### Making Server Accessible

By default, the server binds to `127.0.0.1` which only allows local requests. To allow access from any IP address:

```bash
python main.py --serve --api-host 0.0.0.0
```

## REST API Endpoints

### Health Check

`GET /api/health`

Basic liveness check for the REST server process itself. Does not check any downstream RPC services.

**Authentication:** None required. Public endpoint.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "ValidatorRestServer",
  "timestamp_ms": 1234567890123
}
```

### RPC Health Check

`GET /api/health/rpc`

Fan-out liveness check across every RPC service the validator depends on (position manager, debt ledger, perf ledger, challenge period, elimination, entity, metagraph, weight calculator, etc.). Each service is checked concurrently with a single short-retry connect attempt, so one down or wedged service can't stall the rest of the check.

**Authentication:** None required. Public endpoint.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp_ms": 1234567890123,
  "services": {
    "position_manager": {"status": "ok", "detail": {"...": "..."}},
    "metagraph": {"status": "unreachable", "error": "Connection refused"}
  }
}
```

**Response Fields:**
- `status`: `"healthy"` if every service reports `"ok"`, otherwise `"degraded"`
- `services.<name>.status`: `"ok"` or `"unreachable"` per service
- `services.<name>.detail`: Service-specific health payload (only present when `status` is `"ok"`)
- `services.<name>.error`: Exception message (only present when `status` is `"unreachable"`)

**Status Codes:**
- `200` — all services healthy
- `503` — one or more services unreachable

### All Miners Positions 

`GET /miner-positions`

This endpoint retrieves the positions of all miners, optionally filtered by a specified data freshness tier.

**Tier Parameter**:
- `tier` (optional): Specifies the data freshness tier ['0', '30', '50', '100']
- 0: 100% of positions show data with a 24-hour delay.
- 30: 30% of positions show real-time data, 70% show data with a 24-hour delay. (superset of tier 0)
- 50: 50% of positions show real-time data, 50% show data with a 24-hour delay. (superset of tier 30)
- 100: 100% of positions show real-time data. Equivalent to not providing a tier. (superset of tier 50)

**Response**:
A JSON file containing all miner positions at the specified tier.

Hotkeys are mapped to a data dict. The data dict contains positions which contain orders.

**Explanation of Schema:**
* miner_hotkey: A unique identifier for a miner. This is the same as the Bittensor metagraph hotkey value.
* all_time_returns: The miner's total return on investment across all positions over all time.
* n_positions: The number of positions held by the miner.
* percentage_profitable: The proportion of the miner's positions that have been profitable.
* positions: A list of individual trading positions held by the miner.
* average_entry_price: The average price at which the miner entered the position.
* current_return: The current return on the position with no fees.
* return_at_close: The return on the position at the time it was closed with all fees applied.
* initial_entry_price: The price at which the position was first opened.
* is_closed_position: Indicates if the position is closed.
* net_leverage: The leverage currently used in the position. 0 if the position is closed.
* open_ms: The timestamp (in milliseconds) when the position was opened.
* close_ms: The timestamp (in milliseconds) when the position was closed. 0 if not closed.
* orders: A list of orders executed within the position.
    - leverage: The leverage applied to the order.
    - order_type: The type of order (e.g., SHORT, LONG, FLAT).
    - order_uuid: A unique identifier for the order. Must be unique across all miners
    - price: The price at which the order was executed (filled).
    - price_sources: Used for debugging. Info about the price sources used to determine the price. At the time of this writing the sources are Polygon and Tiingo.
    - src: 0 if the order was placed by the miner, 1 if it was an automatically generated FLAT order due to elimination, 2 for automatically generated FLAT order to due trade pair deprecation. 
    - bid: The bid price at the time of order execution.
    - ask: The ask price at the time of order execution.
* processed_ms: The timestamp (in milliseconds) when the order was processed.
* position_type: The current status of the position (e.g., FLAT, SHORT, LONG).
* position_uuid: A unique identifier for the position.
* trade_pair: Information about the trade pair (e.g., currency pair BTCUSD).

### Single Miner Positions

`GET /miner-positions/<minerid>`

Returns position data for a specific miner identified by their hotkey.

### Miner Hotkeys

`GET /miner-hotkeys`

Returns all the hotkeys as seen in the metagraph from the validator's perspective.

### Miner Dashboard

`GET /miner/<hotkey>`

Comprehensive dashboard for a regular (non-entity) miner hotkey. Aggregates the same per-section data as the [Subaccount Dashboard](#get-subaccount-dashboard-version-2) endpoint (challenge period, drawdown, elimination, account size, positions, limit orders, ledger, statistics), minus the entity-specific `subaccount_info` section. Uses the same `create_subaccount_dashboard` aggregation logic — see that endpoint's docs for the full section-by-section response schema.

**Authentication:** Requires **tier 100 API access**.

**Query Parameters:**
- `positions_time_ms` (int, optional): Only include positions after this timestamp (milliseconds, exclusive)
- `limit_orders_time_ms` (int, optional): Only include limit orders after this timestamp (milliseconds, exclusive)
- `checkpoints_time_ms` (int, optional): Only include ledger checkpoints after this timestamp (milliseconds, exclusive)
- `daily_returns_time_ms` (int, optional): Only include daily returns after this timestamp (milliseconds, exclusive)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "dashboard": {
    "challenge_period": {
      "bucket": "MAINCOMP",
      "start_time_ms": 1702345678901
    },
    "drawdown": { "...": "..." },
    "account_size_data": { "...": "..." },
    "positions": { "...": "..." },
    "limit_orders": { "...": "..." },
    "ledger": { "...": "..." },
    "statistics": { "...": "..." }
  },
  "timestamp": 1702345690000
}
```

Each section is omitted if its underlying manager returns no data (same fail-gracefully behavior as the subaccount dashboard). If every section is empty, the endpoint returns `404`.

**Example:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TIER_100_API_KEY" \
     http://localhost:48888/miner/5GhDr3xy...abc
```

**Error Responses:**
```json
// 401 - missing/invalid API key
{ "error": "Unauthorized access" }

// 403 - insufficient tier access
{ "error": "Your API key does not have access to tier 100 data" }

// 404 - hotkey has no data in any section
{ "error": "Miner 5GhDr3xy...abc not found" }

// 500 - internal error building the dashboard
{ "error": "Internal server error retrieving dashboard" }
```

### Allowed Trade Pairs

`GET /trade-pairs`

Returns all trade pairs grouped into two categories. Use this endpoint to discover which `trade_pair_id` values are valid for placing orders and what leverage constraints apply per pair. Dynamic/legacy HyperLiquid trade pairs no longer exist — the trade pair set is fully static (see `vali_objects/trade_pair.py`).

**Authentication:** None required. Public endpoint.

**Query parameters:**
- `asset_class` (optional): A `MinerAssetClass` value (`crypto`, `forex`, `equities`, `commodities`, `hl_all`, `all_markets`). When provided, `allowed` is further filtered to pairs tradeable by that asset class (via `MinerAssetClass.can_trade`); pairs filtered out are moved to `disabled` instead. Omit to treat all trade pairs as tradeable regardless of asset class. Returns `400` if the value isn't a valid asset class.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "allowed": [
    {
      "trade_pair_id": "BTCUSDC",
      "hl_coin": "BTC",
      "trade_pair": "BTC/USDC",

      "subaccount_positional_leverage_by_tier": {"1": 1.25, "2": 2.5, "3": 3.75, "4": 5.0}
    }
  ],
  "total_allowed": 1100,
  "total_disabled": 24,
  "timestamp": 1749234567890
}
```

**Response fields:**
- `allowed`: Trade pairs that can open and close positions. Includes all active Vanta pairs and hardcoded HyperLiquid pairs (and, when `asset_class` is given, only those tradeable by that asset class).
- `disabled`: Trade pairs that are fully blocked (`is_blocked`) or excluded by the `asset_class` filter — neither opening nor closing is permitted.
- `timestamp`: Response timestamp in milliseconds

**Per-pair fields:**
- `trade_pair_id`: Identifier to use in order requests (e.g., `"BTCUSDC"`)
- `hl_coin`: Underlying Hyperliquid coin symbol for HL-sourced pairs, `null` otherwise
- `trade_pair`: Display format (e.g., `"BTC/USDC"`)
- `trade_pair_category`: Asset class (`crypto`, `forex`, `equities`, `indices`, `commodities`)
- `trade_pair_source`: Data source — `"vanta"` for standard pairs, `"hyperliquid"` for HL-sourced pairs
- `min_leverage` / `max_leverage`: Leverage bounds for this pair
- `subaccount_positional_leverage_by_tier`: Per-tier (1–4) positional leverage multiplier for the subaccount order path
- `lot_size`: Present only for a handful of Hyperliquid commodity pairs (e.g. `GOLDUSDC`); UI convenience field, not used in any network calculation

**Example:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:48888/trade-pairs
curl "http://localhost:48888/trade-pairs?asset_class=crypto"
```

**Error responses:**
```json
// 500 Internal Server Error
{
  "error": "Internal server error retrieving allowed trade pairs"
}
```

### All Miners Statistics 

`GET /statistics`

Returns statistics relevant for scoring miners, consumed by the Taoshi dashboard.

**Parameters**:
- `checkpoints` (optional): Include checkpoint data (default: "true")

### Single Miner Statistics 

`GET /statistics/<minerid>/`

Returns statistics for a specific miner.

### Eliminations

`GET /eliminations`

Returns information about which miners have been eliminated and why. Note: deregistered miners are not shown in this list.
More information can be found here: https://github.com/taoshidev/vanta-network/blob/main/docs/miner.md#miner

e.x:
```json
 "eliminations": [
    {
      "dd": 0.0,
      "elimination_initiated_time_ms": 1711184954891,
      "hotkey": "5Dk2u35LRYEi9SC5cWamtzRkdXJJDLES7gABuey6cJ6t1ajK",
      "reason": "LIQUIDATED"
    },
    {
      "elimination_initiated_time_ms": 1711204151504,
      "hotkey": "5G1iDH2gvdAyrpUD4QfZXATvGEtstRBiXWieRDeaDPRfPEcU",
      "reason": "PLAGIARISM"
    },
    {
```

### Challenge Period Status

`GET /challenge-period/<minerid>`

Challenge-period status for a miner or subaccount hotkey. By default returns only the current bucket; pass `?history=true` to get the full ordered history of bucket transitions instead.

**Query Parameters:**
- `history` (optional, default `false`): When `true`, returns the full ordered list of bucket transitions instead of just the current one.

**Response — default (current bucket only):**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc",
  "challenge_period": {
    "bucket": "MAINCOMP",
    "start_time_ms": 1702345678901
  },
  "timestamp": 1702345690000
}
```

**Response — `?history=true`:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc",
  "history": [
    {"bucket": "CHALLENGE", "start_time_ms": 1690000000000},
    {"bucket": "MAINCOMP", "start_time_ms": 1695000000000},
    {"bucket": "PROBATION", "start_time_ms": 1700000000000},
    {"bucket": "ELIMINATED", "start_time_ms": 1702345678901, "reason": "FAILED_PROBATION_TIME"}
  ],
  "timestamp": 1702345690000
}
```

Any bucket entry with `bucket: "ELIMINATED"` has a `reason` field joined in from the elimination record.

**Examples:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     http://localhost:48888/challenge-period/5GhDr3xy...abc

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     "http://localhost:48888/challenge-period/5GhDr3xy...abc?history=true"
```

**Error Responses:**
```json
// 401 - missing/invalid API key
{ "error": "Unauthorized access" }

// 404 - hotkey not found
{ "error": "Miner ID 5GhDr3xy...abc not found" }

// 500 - internal error retrieving challenge period data
{ "error": "Internal server error retrieving challenge period data" }
```

### Set Miner Bucket (admin)

`POST /admin/miner-bucket/<hotkey>`

Moves a miner or subaccount into a specific bucket. This is the only way into the pro account
track — see [entity_miner.md](entity_miner.md#account-types).

Requires **tier 500** access. Like every `/admin/*` route, calls are recorded in the audit log.

**Body:**
- `bucket` (string, required): a `MinerBucket` value, e.g. `PRO_CHALLENGE_TRANSITION`.
- `pro_account_size` (number, required when entering the pro track): USD size of the granted pro
  account. Snapshotted alongside the subaccount's existing size, which becomes its
  `standard_account_size` and the basis for payouts during the pro challenge. Omit on later pro
  moves to keep the size already recorded.

When the target bucket changes the account size, the subaccount's open positions are force closed,
its pending limit orders are cancelled, and its ledgers restart against the new size.
`PRO_CHALLENGE_TRANSITION` keeps the standard account, so nothing is reset when entering it.

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:48888/admin/miner-bucket/5GhDr3xy...abc_1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bucket": "PRO_CHALLENGE_TRANSITION", "pro_account_size": 500000}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc_1",
  "bucket": "PRO_CHALLENGE_TRANSITION",
  "message": "5GhDr3xy...abc_1 moved to PRO_CHALLENGE_TRANSITION"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
```json
// 400 - unknown bucket, missing pro_account_size, or miner already in that bucket
{ "error": "pro_account_size is required to enter the pro track" }

// 403 - API key below tier 500
{ "error": "Set miner bucket endpoint requires tier 500 access" }
```

### Validator Checkpoint 

`GET /validator-checkpoint`

Everything required for a validator to restore it's state when starting for the first time. This includes all miner positions as well as derived data such as perf ledgers, challenge period data, and eliminations.

Perf ledgers are portfolio-level only (no per-trade-pair ledgers). Each hotkey maps directly to a single `PerfLedger` object.

### Perf Ledger (Single Miner)

`GET /perf-ledger/<minerid>`

Returns the portfolio-level performance ledger for a single miner. Requires a valid API key.

**Parameters:**
- `minerid`: The miner's hotkey (SS58 address)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "<hotkey>": {
    "initialization_time_ms": 1714140000000,
    "max_return": 1.0423,
    "target_cp_duration_ms": 21600000,

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Error responses:**
- `404` — miner not found or no ledger data available
- `503` — perf ledger service not available

> **Breaking change from V2 bundle format:** Previously the response was nested as `{ hotkey: { "portfolio": { "cps": [...] }, "BTCUSD": { "cps": [...] }, ... } }`. The ledger is now portfolio-only and returned flat as `{ hotkey: { "cps": [...], ... } }`.

## All Orders (Unified)

The orders endpoint provides a unified view of all orders for a miner, combining unfilled/cancelled limit orders with filled orders from positions.

**Access Requirements:**
- Requires **tier 100 API access**

### Get All Orders

`GET /orders/<minerid>`

Retrieve all orders for a specific miner, grouped by status. This endpoint combines:
- **Unfilled/Cancelled**: Limit and bracket orders from the LimitOrderManager (same source as `/limit-orders`)
- **Filled**: Orders extracted from the miner's positions

**Query Parameters:**
- `status` (optional): Comma-separated list of status values to filter by. Valid values: `unfilled`, `filled`, `cancelled`. Defaults to all three if not specified.

**Response Format:**

Orders are always grouped by status:

## Entity Management

The entity management endpoints enable entity miners to register, create subaccounts, and manage trading under a hierarchical account structure. Entity miners can operate multiple subaccounts (each with its own synthetic hotkey) for diversified trading strategies.

**Access Requirements:**
- All entity management endpoints require **tier 200 API access**
- Standard API keys (tier 0-100) will receive a 403 Forbidden response

### Key Concepts

**Entity Miner:** A parent account that can create and manage multiple subaccounts. Entity miners register with a unique hotkey (VANTA_ENTITY_HOTKEY).

**Subaccount:** A trading account under an entity with its own synthetic hotkey. Each subaccount can place orders independently and has separate performance tracking.

**Synthetic Hotkey:** A generated identifier for subaccounts following the format `{entity_hotkey}_{subaccount_id}` (e.g., `5GhDr3xy...abc_0`). Synthetic hotkeys are used for all trading operations.

### Register Entity

`POST /entity/register`

Register a new entity miner that can create and manage subaccounts.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "entity_hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Entity 5GhDr3xy...abc registered successfully",
  "entity_hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc"
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `entity_hotkey` (string, required): The entity's hotkey SS58 address
- `collateral_amount` (float, optional): Collateral amount in alpha tokens (default: 0.0)

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:48888/entity/register \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TIER_200_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc"}'
```

### Request Entity API Key

`POST /request-api-key`

Returns (or creates) the validator API key for a registered entity. This key grants tier 200 access and is used to authenticate the entity miner gateway's WebSocket connection. Calling this endpoint multiple times for the same entity hotkey returns the same key (idempotent).

**Authentication:** Coldkey signature (no existing API key required).

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "entity_coldkey": "<coldkey_ss58>",
  "entity_hotkey": "<hotkey_ss58>",
  "signature": "<coldkey_signature>"
}
```

The signature is produced by signing `{"entity_coldkey": "...", "entity_hotkey": "..."}` (JSON, sorted keys) with the coldkey — the same signing scheme as `/entity/register`.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "api_key": "<token>"
}
```

**Error Responses:**

| Code | Cause |
|------|-------|
| 400 | Missing or invalid field |
| 401 | Signature verification failed or coldkey does not own hotkey |
| 403 | Entity hotkey is not registered |

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:48888/request-api-key \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entity_coldkey": "5FxY...",
    "entity_hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc",
    "signature": "0x..."
  }'
```

Store the returned `api_key` as `validator_api_key` in the entity miner's `miner_secrets.json`. This key is typically obtained via `vanta entity apikey` rather than calling this endpoint directly.

### Create Subaccount

`POST /entity/create-subaccount`
`POST /entity/create-hl-subaccount` *(alias — both routes call the same implementation)*

Create a new trading subaccount under an entity. The subaccount receives a unique synthetic hotkey that can be used for order placement. This endpoint handles both standard subaccounts and Hyperliquid-linked subaccounts — the presence of the `hl_address` field in the request body selects the HL path.

**Authentication:** Coldkey signature (no API key required — the request is signed by the entity's coldkey).

**Request Body — Standard subaccount:**
```json
{
  "entity_hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc",
  "entity_coldkey": "5FxY...",
  "account_size": 50000,
  "asset_class": "crypto",
  "drawdown_criteria": "trailing",
  "signature": "0x...",
  "version": "2.0.0"
}
```

**Request Body — Hyperliquid-linked subaccount:**
```json
{
  "entity_hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc",
  "entity_coldkey": "5FxY...",
  "account_size": 50000,
  "asset_class": "hl_all",
  "hl_address": "0xabcd1234...ef56",
  "payout_address": "0xAbCd...1234",
  "signature": "0x...",
  "version": "2.0.0"
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `entity_hotkey` (string, required): The entity's hotkey SS58 address
- `entity_coldkey` (string, required): The entity's coldkey SS58 address
- `account_size` (float, required): Account size in USD. Must be positive.
- `asset_class` (string, required): `"crypto"`, `"forex"`, `"equities"`, or `"commodities"` for standard subaccounts. HL-linked subaccounts (with `hl_address`) use `"hl_all"`.
- `signature` (string, required): Coldkey signature over the sorted-JSON of `{account_size, asset_class, entity_coldkey, entity_hotkey}` (plus `hl_address` and optionally `payout_address` for HL subaccounts). `drawdown_criteria` is not part of the signed payload.
- `hl_address` (string, optional): Hyperliquid wallet address (`0x` + 40 hex chars). Presence selects the HL subaccount path.
- `payout_address` (string, optional, HL only): EVM address for USDC payouts (`0x` + 40 hex chars).
- `drawdown_criteria` (string, optional): `"trailing"` (default) or `"static"` — see [Static vs. Trailing Drawdown Rules](#static-vs-trailing-drawdown-rules). Fixed for the life of the subaccount once created. HL-linked subaccounts always get `"trailing"` regardless of what's passed.
- `account_type` (string, optional): must be `"standard"` (the default). Pro accounts are granted by admin promotion via `POST /admin/miner-bucket/<synthetic_hotkey>`, never at creation — see [entity_miner.md](entity_miner.md#account-types). Not part of the signed payload.
- `version` (string, optional): vanta-cli version string for compatibility checking.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Subaccount 0 created successfully",
  "subaccount": {
    "subaccount_id": 0,
    "subaccount_uuid": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "synthetic_hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc_0",
    "asset_class": "crypto",
    "account_size": 50000.0,
    "drawdown_criteria": "trailing",
    "status": "active",
    "created_at_ms": 1702345678901,
    "eliminated_at_ms": null
  }
}
```

**Response Fields:**
- `subaccount_id`: Monotonically increasing ID (0, 1, 2, ...)
- `subaccount_uuid`: Unique identifier for the subaccount
- `synthetic_hotkey`: Generated hotkey for trading operations (`{entity_hotkey}_{id}`)
- `asset_class`: Asset class assigned to this subaccount
- `account_size`: USD account size
- `drawdown_criteria`: Drawdown rule set for this subaccount (`"trailing"` or `"static"`), fixed at creation
- `status`: Current status (`"active"`, `"eliminated"`, or `"unknown"`)
- `created_at_ms`: Timestamp when subaccount was created
- `eliminated_at_ms`: Timestamp when eliminated (null if active)

**Important Notes:**
- Subaccount IDs are monotonically increasing and never reused
- The synthetic hotkey must be used for all trading operations
- Entity hotkeys cannot place orders directly (only subaccounts can trade)
- New subaccounts are automatically broadcasted to all validators in the network
- The entity miner gateway (`EntityMinerRestServer`) handles signing and forwarding — end users typically call the miner-side endpoint rather than this one directly

### Set Entity Endpoint

`POST /entity/set-endpoint`

Register the entity miner's public REST gateway URL with the validator. The validator stores this URL and uses it to direct HL address lookups. Called automatically by the entity miner gateway at startup.

**Authentication:** Coldkey signature (no API key required).

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "entity_hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc",
  "entity_coldkey": "5FxY...",
  "endpoint_url": "https://my-gateway.example.com",
  "signature": "0x..."
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `entity_hotkey` (string, required): The entity's hotkey SS58 address
- `entity_coldkey` (string, required): The entity's coldkey SS58 address
- `endpoint_url` (string, required): Publicly reachable URL of the entity miner gateway
- `signature` (string, required): Coldkey signature over sorted-JSON of `{endpoint_url, entity_coldkey, entity_hotkey}`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Endpoint URL set successfully",
  "entity_hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc",
  "endpoint_url": "https://my-gateway.example.com"
}
```

### Get Subaccount Dashboard (version 2)

`GET /v2/entity/subaccount/<synthetic_hotkey>`

Retrieve comprehensive dashboard data for a specific subaccount by aggregating information from multiple systems.

**Aggregated Data Includes:**
- Subaccount info (status, timestamps, entity parent)
- Challenge period status (bucket, start time, progress)
- Drawdown stats (trailing and static rule inputs/thresholds, applicable criteria — synthetic hotkeys only)
- Debt ledger data (performance metrics, returns)
- Position data (open positions, leverage, PnL)
- Statistics (daily returns)
- Elimination status (if eliminated)

**Parameters:**
- `positions_time_ms` (int): Only include positions after this timestamp (milliseconds, exclusive)
- `limit_orders_time_ms` (int): Only include limit orders after this timestamp (milliseconds, exclusive)
- `checkpoints_time_ms` (int): Only include ledger checkpoints after this timestamp (milliseconds, exclusive)
- `daily_returns_time_ms` (int): Only include daily returns after this timestamp (milliseconds, exclusive)

**Example:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TIER_200_API_KEY" \

**Response Field Descriptions:**

**Subaccount Info:**

This is the only guaranteed section of the response. All other sections may be missing if they do not contain new information or the manager that supplies the information is not available.
- `synthetic_hotkey`: The subaccount's synthetic hotkey ({entity_hotkey}_{subaccount_id})
- `subaccount_uuid`: Unique identifier for this subaccount
- `asset_class`: Asset class (crypto, forex, etc.)
- `account_size`: Current account size (in USD)
- `status`: Current status ("active", "eliminated", or "unknown")
- `created_at_ms`: Timestamp when subaccount was created
- `eliminated_at_ms`: Timestamp when eliminated (null if active)

**Challenge Period:**
- `bucket`: Challenge period bucket ("CHALLENGE", "MAINCOMP", "PROBATION", etc.)
- `start_time_ms`: Timestamp when challenge period started

**Drawdown (synthetic hotkeys only):**

Only present after the first challenge period evaluation cycle (~60s after startup). Values match exactly what the evaluation loop computed. All fields below are always computed and present regardless of which rule set applies to this subaccount (see [Static vs. Trailing Drawdown Rules](#static-vs-trailing-drawdown-rules)) — `criteria` indicates which pair of fields actually drives elimination for this subaccount.
- `current_equity`: Portfolio equity at last evaluation: `(balance + unrealized_pnl) / account_size`
- `current_balance`: Portfolio balance at last evaluation, excluding unrealized PnL: `balance / account_size`
- `daily_open_equity`: Equity at today's midnight UTC checkpoint (trailing Rule 1 baseline). Defaults to `1.0` if no midnight checkpoint exists yet.
- `eod_hwm`: Highest end-of-day equity across all midnight checkpoints ever (trailing Rule 2 high water mark). Defaults to `1.0` if no midnight checkpoints exist.
- `last_eod_equity`: Most recent midnight checkpoint equity. Defaults to `1.0` if no midnight checkpoints exist yet.
- `intraday_drawdown_pct`: Percentage drop from `daily_open_equity` to `current_equity`. Positive = drawdown, negative = gain since open. Drives elimination for both `criteria` values — the check is identical, only `intraday_drawdown_threshold` differs.
- `eod_drawdown_pct`: Percentage drop from `eod_hwm` to `last_eod_equity`. `0.0` if no midnight checkpoints exist. Drives elimination only when `criteria` is `"trailing"` (EOD rule).
- `static_drawdown_pct`: Percentage drop from starting balance (`1.0`) to `current_equity` (includes unrealized PnL). Drives elimination when `criteria` is `"static"`.
- `static_eod_drawdown_pct`: Percentage drop from starting balance (`1.0`) to `last_eod_equity`. Retired — no longer drives elimination for any subaccount, kept in the payload for dashboard/API compatibility only.
- `current_return`: `min(current_equity, current_balance) - 1.0` — used for challenge-period promotion, independent of drawdown criteria.
- `intraday_drawdown_threshold`: Elimination threshold for the intraday drawdown rule (e.g. `0.05` = 5%). For `"static"` subaccounts this is always a flat 5%, regardless of bucket or registration time; for `"trailing"` it's the bucket/registration-time-dependent value.
- `eod_drawdown_threshold`: Elimination threshold for the trailing EOD rule (e.g. `0.05` = 5%).
- `static_drawdown_threshold`: Elimination threshold for the static starting-balance rule (`0.05` = 5%).
- `static_eod_drawdown_threshold`: Retired rule's threshold — no longer enforced, kept for dashboard payload compatibility.
- `criteria`: Which rule set is actually applied for this subaccount — `"trailing"` or `"static"`. Mirrors `subaccount_info.drawdown_criteria`, fixed at creation.

#### Static vs. Trailing Drawdown Rules

Each subaccount is assigned a `drawdown_criteria` at creation (see [Create Subaccount](#create-subaccount)) that never changes for the life of the subaccount:
- **`"trailing"`** (default): eliminated at intraday drawdown from the day's opening equity, or drawdown from the end-of-day equity high-water mark, reaching the applicable threshold (5% during challenge, 8% once funded — same as regular miners).
- **`"static"`**: eliminated when equity (including unrealized PnL) drops more than 5% below the subaccount's starting balance, or when intraday drawdown from the day's opening equity reaches 5% — the same intraday-drawdown check used for trailing accounts, just with the threshold pinned to a flat 5% instead of the bucket/registration-time lookup. These thresholds do not change between challenge and funded periods. HL-linked subaccounts always use `"trailing"`.

Elimination reasons reflect which rule triggered: `FAILED_CHALLENGE_PERIOD_STATIC_DRAWDOWN` / `FAILED_FUNDED_PERIOD_STATIC_DRAWDOWN` for the starting-balance rule. The intraday drawdown rule reuses the same `FAILED_CHALLENGE_PERIOD_INTRADAY_DRAWDOWN` / `FAILED_FUNDED_PERIOD_INTRADAY_DRAWDOWN` reasons for both `"static"` and `"trailing"` subaccounts — check `criteria` to tell which threshold actually applied. `FAILED_*_STATIC_EOD_DRAWDOWN` is retired and no longer produced, but remains a valid value on historical elimination rows.

- `start_time_ms` (int, required): Start timestamp in milliseconds (inclusive). Must be Monday 00:00:00 UTC or `0`
- `end_time_ms` (int, required): End timestamp in milliseconds (inclusive). Must align to a 12-hour boundary

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:48888/entity/subaccount/payout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TIER_200_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subaccount_uuid": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "start_time_ms": 1702252800000,
    "end_time_ms": 1702857600000
  }'
```

**Response Fields:**
- `hotkey`: The synthetic hotkey of the subaccount
- `total_checkpoints`: Total number of debt ledger checkpoints across the subaccount's history
- `checkpoints`: Array of all debt ledger checkpoint data for the subaccount
- `weekly_settlements`: Array of per-week payout breakdowns. Each entry includes:
  - `start_ms`: Monday 00:00:00 UTC start of the week
  - `end_ms`: Monday 00:00:00 UTC end of the week (exclusive)
  - `eow_balance`: Cumulative realized PnL minus fees at end of week
  - `eow_unrealized`: Unrealized PnL at the nearest checkpoint before week end
  - `payout`: `max(0, eow_balance - prev_hwm + min(0, eow_unrealized))` for this week
  - `orders`: Orders with non-zero realized PnL that settled in this week
- `payout`: Sum of weekly payouts for weeks whose `start_ms >= start_time_ms`

**Important Notes:**
- Timestamps must be valid integers and non-negative
- `start_time_ms` must be Monday 00:00:00 UTC or `0`
- `end_time_ms` must align to a 12-hour boundary
- `start_time_ms` must be less than or equal to `end_time_ms`
- Returns 404 if the subaccount is not found, is not in a funded/alpha bucket, or has no orders
- Payout uses a weekly high-water mark (HWM) model: only weeks where balance exceeds the previous HWM contribute to payout

### Entity Trading Workflow

**1. Register as an entity miner:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:48888/entity/register \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TIER_200_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_hotkey": "5GhDr..."}'
```

**2. Create subaccounts:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:48888/entity/create-subaccount \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TIER_200_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_hotkey": "5GhDr..."}'
```

**3. Place orders using synthetic hotkeys:**
- Use the `synthetic_hotkey` (e.g., `5GhDr..._0`) returned from subaccount creation
- Submit orders via the standard Vanta order placement mechanism
- Each subaccount trades independently with its own positions and performance tracking

**4. Monitor performance:**
```bash
# Get dashboard data for a subaccount
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TIER_200_API_KEY" \
     http://localhost:48888/entity/subaccount/5GhDr..._0

# Get all entity data
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TIER_200_API_KEY" \
     http://localhost:48888/entity/5GhDr...
```

### Entity Management with Python

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_TIER_200_API_KEY"
BASE_URL = "http://localhost:48888"
HEADERS = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Register entity
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/entity/register",
    headers=HEADERS,
    json={
        "entity_hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc",
        "collateral_amount": 5000.0,
        "max_subaccounts": 10
    }
)
print(f"Entity registered: {response.json()}")

# Create subaccount
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/entity/create-subaccount",
    headers=HEADERS,
    json={"entity_hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc"}
)
subaccount = response.json()["subaccount"]
synthetic_hotkey = subaccount["synthetic_hotkey"]
print(f"Created subaccount with synthetic hotkey: {synthetic_hotkey}")

# Get entity data
response = requests.get(
    f"{BASE_URL}/entity/5GhDr3xy...abc",
    headers=HEADERS
)
entity_data = response.json()["entity"]
print(f"Entity has {len(entity_data['subaccounts'])} subaccounts")

# Get subaccount dashboard
response = requests.get(
    f"{BASE_URL}/entity/subaccount/{synthetic_hotkey}",
    headers=HEADERS
)
dashboard = response.json()["dashboard"]
print(f"Subaccount status: {dashboard['subaccount_info']['status']}")

# Eliminate subaccount (if needed)
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/entity/subaccount/eliminate",
    headers=HEADERS,
    json={
        "entity_hotkey": "5GhDr3xy...abc",
        "subaccount_id": 0,
        "reason": "poor_performance"
    }
)
print(f"Elimination result: {response.json()}")
```

## Compression Support

The API server supports automatic gzip compression for REST responses, which can significantly reduce payload sizes and improve performance. Compression is particularly beneficial for large responses like miner positions and statistics.

### Compression Benefits

- **Reduced Bandwidth**: Responses can be compressed by 70-90%, especially for JSON data
- **Faster Transmission**: Smaller payloads lead to quicker response times
- **Lower Costs**: Reduced data transfer costs with cloud hosting providers

### Using Compression with curl

To request compressed responses with curl, use the `--compressed` flag:

```bash
# Get positions with compression
curl --compressed -X GET "http://<server_ip>:48888/miner-positions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"

# Get positions with a specific tier (compressed)
curl --compressed -X GET "http://<server_ip>:48888/miner-positions?tier=30" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"

# Check the size of the response without displaying it
curl -s --compressed -X GET "http://<server_ip>:48888/miner-positions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" -o /dev/null -w 'Size: %{size_download} bytes\n'

# View detailed headers to confirm compression
curl -v --compressed -X GET "http://<server_ip>:48888/miner-positions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" > /dev/null
```

## WebSocket API

The WebSocket API enables real-time streaming of trading data and updates.

### Connection and Authentication

After connecting to the WebSocket server at `ws://<server_ip>:8765`, clients must authenticate:

```json
{
  "api_key": "your_api_key",
  "last_sequence": -1
}
```

The `last_sequence` parameter helps track message continuity and allows clients to resume from where they left off.

### Websocket Message Format

Messages from the websocket server are parsed into VantaWebsocketMessage ([vanta_api/websocket_client.py](vanta_api/websocket_client.py)) objects which mirror the position data from the REST endpoint.

This data is serialized into a Vanta Position object, and the server will send a message with the sequence number of the last message sent. Sequence number can be used to detect gaps in the message stream. The client can use this to make a REST call to fill in the gaps.

Lag info is also included in the message. lag from the queue is lag from when the order was made available to the websocket server. Lag from the order is lag from when the order was placed and is larger due to variable time in price filling and order processing in the Vanta repo.

Here a snippet of a terminal printing VantaWebsocketMessage objects:
```bash

```

### API Key Management

Each API key is limited to a maximum of 5 concurrent WebSocket connections. When this limit is reached, the oldest connection will be automatically disconnected to make room for new connections.

## Running the Server

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages: flask, waitress, flask_compress, websockets

### Launching the Server

```bash
python validator_api_manager.py --serve
```

## Client Usage Examples

### REST API with cURL

```bash
# Get positions with compression
curl --compressed -X GET "http://<server_ip>:48888/miner-positions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"

# Get positions with a specific tier
curl --compressed -X GET "http://<server_ip>:48888/miner-positions?tier=30" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"

# Check the size of the response without displaying it
curl -s --compressed -X GET "http://<server_ip>:48888/miner-positions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" -o /dev/null -w 'Size: %{size_download} bytes\n'
```

### REST API with Python

```python
import requests
import json

# Basic request (compression is enabled by default in requests)
url = 'http://<server_ip>:48888/validator-checkpoint'
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key'}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
data = response.json()

# Check if compression was used
if 'Content-Encoding' in response.headers:
    print(f"Response was compressed using: {response.headers['Content-Encoding']}")
    # The requests library automatically decompresses the response
    print(f"Original compressed size (approximate): {len(response.content)} bytes")
    print(f"Decompressed size: {len(response.text)} bytes")

# Save to file
with open('validator_checkpoint.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)

# Using a session for multiple requests (more efficient)
with requests.Session() as session:
    session.headers.update({'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key'})
    
    # Get miner positions
    pos_response = session.get('http://<server_ip>:48888/miner-positions')
    positions = pos_response.json()
    
    # Get statistics
    stats_response = session.get('http://<server_ip>:48888/statistics')
    statistics = stats_response.json()
```

### WebSocket Client with Python

Our WebSocket client ([vanta_api/websocket_client.py](vanta_api/websocket_client.py)) provides a simple interface for receiving real-time data:

```python
from vanta_api.websocket_client import VantaWebSocketClient
import sys

...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Get API key from command line argument or use default
    api_key = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "test_key"
    host = sys.argv[2] if len(sys.argv) > 2 else "localhost"
    port = int(sys.argv[3]) if len(sys.argv) > 3 else 8765


    # Define a simple message handler. print position and order details
    def handle_messages(messages):
        for msg in messages:
            print(f"\nReceived message {msg}")
    # Create client
    print(f"Connecting to ws://{host}:{port} with API key: {api_key}")
    client = VantaWebSocketClient(api_key=api_key, host=host, port=port)

    # Run client
    client.run(handle_messages)
```

### Async Message Handler

For more complex processing, you can use async handlers:

```python
from vanta_api.websocket_client import VantaWebSocketClient, VantaWebSocketMessage
import asyncio
from typing import List


async def process_message(msg: VantaWebSocketMessage):
    # Example: Check bid/ask spread
    if msg.new_order.bid and msg.new_order.ask:
        spread = msg.new_order.ask - msg.new_order.bid
        spread_bps = (spread / msg.new_order.price) * 10000  # Basis points

        # Only log significant spreads
        if spread_bps > 10:  # More than 10 bps
            return f"{msg.new_order.trade_pair}: Spread {spread_bps:.1f} bps"

    # Example: Track specific pairs
    if msg.new_order.trade_pair == "BTCUSD":
        return f"BTC: ${msg.new_order.price:.2f} ({msg.new_order.order_type})"

    return None


async def async_handler(messages: List[VantaWebSocketMessage]):
    # Process messages concurrently
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[process_message(msg) for msg in messages])

    # Print non-None results
    for result in filter(None, results):
        print(result)


# Run with async handler
client = VantaWebSocketClient(api_key="your_api_key_here")
client.subscribe()
client.run(async_handler)
```


## Best Practices for Trading Logic

1. **Use the Provided Client:**
   - Our WebSocketClient handles all the complexity of reliable message delivery
   - Focus on your trading strategy instead of communication infrastructure

2. **Process Messages Efficiently:**
    - Create separate handler functions for different order types
    - Use properties of the order object to make trading decisions
    - Track processed order UUIDs to avoid duplicate processing
    - Check the timestamp and time lag to ensure orders aren't stale before acting on them

3. **Optimize Network Usage:**
    - Always use compression for REST API requests to reduce bandwidth
    - For bulk data retrieval, use the REST API with compression
    - For real-time updates, use the WebSocket API
    - Monitor compression ratios to ensure they're working as expected

## Security Considerations

Store your API keys in a secure location with appropriate file permissions. The system will automatically reload the keys when the file changes.

For production, deploy the API server behind a reverse proxy that handles SSL/TLS termination:

```
Client <--HTTPS--> Nginx/Apache <--HTTP--> API Server
```
